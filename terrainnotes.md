To refine past a tile, one of the following conditions must be met:

   * The tile is loaded.
   * The tile has a SSE that is _known_ (not just suspected) to be too high AND we know which of the tile's children exist. We'll know the SSE is too high if:
      * The distance to the tile is known accurately (e.g. we know the precise min/max height), or
      * The bounding volume for the tile is known to be X or _closer_, and X is sufficient to necessitate refinement. For example, if we have no min/max height information for this tile, but the parent tile has a min of A and a max of B, we know the child must fall within these bounds as well. Therefore, the child tile can be no farther away than max(distance to A, distance to B).

Idea: when a tile is determined to be _fully_ visible based on min/max heights from an ancestor, and it meets the SSE, we can be certain that either that tile or its children are relevant for rendering. But if it's only partially visible, we might load it only to find out that it's culled. So, when we have BVH data available, and a tile is only partially visible based on estimated heights, we should load the nearest ancestor BVH node instead of loading the tile.

GlobeSurfaceTile properties:

   * `tileBoundingRegion` is used to estimate the distance to the tile. It is _not_ used for culling.
   * `orientedBoundingBox` is used for culling, _not_ for distance estimation.
   * `minimumHeight` and `maximumheight` are used for picking, for culling in 2D, and for `updateHeights` in `QuadtreePrimitive`.


A tile conceptually has three sets of min/max heights:

   * The spatially coherent min/max of the real terrain in this horizontal extent, i.e. the min/max of this tile and all its descendants.
      * Distance estimation: Great!
      * Culling for rendering: Great!
      * Skipping loading: Great!
   * The min/max of the geometry, which may not reflect the full range of heights of descendants.
      * Distance estimation: Not perfect, but should be good enough.
      * Culling for rendering: Great!
      * Skipping loading: Not perfect, but should be good enough.
   * The (spatially coherent) min/max of the parent tile, applied to this tile.
      * Distance estimation: Tile is guaranteed to be closer than the farther-away height surface (min or max).
      * Culling for rendering: If test says its invisible, it definitely is. If test says its visible, it may or may not be.
      * Skipping loading: We can skip loading if the tile is culled.

    * renderable (true if the tile is renderable at all)
* Populated by non-tile loading
    * childTileMask / getTileDataAvailable (not stored on tile directly, comes from terrainData.childTileMask or TerrainProvider.getTileDataAvailable, determines if we need to upsample)

    * replacementPrevious / replacementNext (This tile's position in the TileReplacementQueue linked list)

    * pickBoundingSphere (assigned and used in Globe#pick, not clear why this needs to be a tile property)
    * pickTerrain (points to either the loaded or upsampled TileTerrain instance)
    * minimumHeight / maximumHeight (same as the min/max height in tileBoundingRegion?)
* Not sure
    * _priorityFunction (used to prioritize requests, returns the tile's distance to the tileBoundingRegion)
    * _customData (custom data that is inside the bounds of this tile)
    * _frameUpdated (used in QuadtreeTile#_updateCustomData to determine when a parent tile was updated more (?) recently than this tile)
    * _frameRendered (used in QuadtreePrimitive#createRenderCommandsForSelectedTiles to determine which tiles need updated heights)
    * _loadedCallbacks (used for WMTS (?) to remove old imagery once new imagery is loaded. I think.)


TileBoundingRegion has a both an oriented bounding box and a bounding sphere, but we don't use either of them for terrain.
Instead, tiles store separate copies of these things (orientingBoundingBox and boundingSphere3D). That's probably good because we update the min/max height in publishToTile but we don't update either of the other two.

## Rendering without data

When the camera moves, new tiles become visible. If those tiles aren't loaded yet, what do we do? Options are:

   1. Render nothing. There will be holes in the Earth's surface.
   2. Upsample synchronously. Each upsample takes 2-3ms on a fast computer so we can't do much of this without the frame rate taking a dive.
   3. Render an ancestor tile and discard fragments outside the bounds of the tile. This is nearly free on the CPU, but expensive on the GPU because we end up rendering large tiles and discarding most of the fragments.
   4. Create a tile on-the-fly to fill the space, e.g. that aligns with the edge vertices of adjacent tiles.
   5. Don't refine until all descendants are renderable (but do load the descendants we want to render, of course!).
   6. Show some kind of blurry blobby placeholder for the not-yet-available tile.

Number 5 is a tempting strategy, with one big problem: it can cause us to lose detail from the scene with small camera movements. For example, if we're looking at a detailed scene that shows 3 out of 4 children of a level 14 tile, and then move the camera so that the 4th is visible, suddenly that level 14 tile isn't refinable anymore. If we start rendering that level 14 tiles intead of its children, we'll lose detail from the scene for a second until that 4th tile loads. This looks really bad.

Important rules:
* if we rendered a tile last frame, and it's still visible and the correct SSE this frame, we must render it this frame. In the scenario above, we must use one of our other strategies to fill the space of that 4th child of the level 14 tiles.
* Detail should never disappear when zooming in. i.e. upsampling is ok, but creating fill tiles is not.
* We can create fill tiles for areas the user hasn't seen recently.

Specifically:
* Ancestor rendered last frame -> upsample (e.g. zooming in)
* Descendants rendered last frame but now this tile meets SSE -> continue rendering descendants, create fill tiles as necessary for areas that weren't previously visible (e.g. zooming out)
  * _Optionally_ we can preload ancestors to optimize the zoom out experience.
  * Note that this applies to imagery too! Zooming out should never cause detail to disappear and then come back.
* Sub-tree was culled last frame but now it's visible -> create fill tiles as necessary (e.g. panning)

## Min/max heights

Tiles have min/max heights in a whole bunch of places ðŸ˜¨:
* GlobeSurfaceTile.tileBoundingRegion
* GlobeSurfaceTile.terrainData
